===============

My first, independent rails app. Moccasin uses a blog structure to let users post and share ordered lists of lifestyle-routines.
For example, a yoga instructor can post a step-by-step guide to an easy morning yoga routine. An artist can post a routine they go 
through before they begin drawing.
